# Honeydew Grocery List

Honeydew is a simple grocery list designed for families and available for Android, Alex, and Google Assistant.

## Honeydew for Android

This is the Android client for Honeydew, previously available on the Google Play Store. Youâ€™ll find it similar to [Our Groceries](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en_US&gl=US). I don't have time to maintain it, so I'm giving it to the world for free.

## Other Honeydew components

You can build the Android client, but it won't be super interesting on its own. The real magic is in the syncing with other devices and services, which require other components:

- Honeydew Server
- Honeydew for Google Assistant
- Honeydew for Alexa
